UCWL-Internship-Summer-2020

In this project a machine learning model for predective maintainance was developed using keras. The performance of the model was compared using Gaussian Anomalous detection method. The model is able to dectect true positve anomalies correctly. The project was done for two months as summer internship of 2020.
